For my first week intern task, I have selected the craigslist web page. Its a simple, text-focused layout provides quick access to a wide range of categories and listings without unnecessary distractions..But Craigslist homepage does not clearly communicate the overall objective of the website to new users. It can take some time for first-time visitors to fully understand the site’s purpose and how to navigate its offerings.

Although Craigslist features many categories such as housing, jobs, services, and community activities,it cant convey the categories in such a simple way.The site primarily relies on text links without any supporting icons or images that makes users difficult to recognize and differentiate the categories. In this modern era ,users are more convenient with icons,images and GUI based interfaces which is user friendly to understand the functionality of the website and how to work on it.This observation motivated me to redesign the Craigslist landing page with a focus on improving user experience and visual clarity.

In my redesign, I started by adding a prominent header section that clearly displays the logo and brand name using a distinctive, modern font. This helps establish a strong brand identity and makes the site instantly recognizable. Below the header, I introduced a navigation bar organized into distinct categories such as “Home,” “Sales,” “Jobs,” and “Community”. Each navigation menu item reveals sub-options and specific functionalities related to that category, making it easier for users to explore the site’s offerings without confusion.

I added the search bar in the center of the page. This helps users to input their requirements and find the listings or services they need quickly.To enhance usability further, I incorporated colorful icons, buttons, and images throughout the page. For example, there are clearly labeled buttons for specific tasks like “Post an Ad” and “Event Calendar,” which visually guide users toward important actions.This makes the webpage more  userfriendly.

Additionally, I included a “Features” section with representative images and concise descriptions to help users immediately understand the core purposes of the website. Since images are often more effective than text alone at communicating ideas quickly, this section serves as a visual summary of what Craigslist offers.For the color, I chose a purple-based gradient background. Purple is associated with loyalty and creativity. So it provides a visually attractive web pages. Finally my design provides user friends and GUI based interface.
